# Assignment 4A

This app displays the information and the works of an author from the few popular ones on the right side bar or from a search at the top navigation. This tests my knowledge of the component lifecycle (mount, update, unmount) and communicating with RESTful APIs.


This app uses the [Internet Archives "Open Library" API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
